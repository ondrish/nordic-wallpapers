# Nordic Wallpapers
A collection of wallpapers cherry picked from [reddit](https://reddit.com/r/ImageGoNord), [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/t/wallpapers),
[Christian Chiarulli's discord server](https://discord.gg/Xb9B4Ny) and
[ThePrimeagen's wallpaper repository](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/anime).
Most of 'em "norded" through
[ImageGoNord](https://ign.schrodinger-hat.it "ImageGoNord") website from
[SchrÃ¶dinger-Hat](https://github.com/Schrodinger-Hat).

Previews of the wallpapers can be seen in [here](/wallpaper-preview.md).
